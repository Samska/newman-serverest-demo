## API Testing using Postman + Newman Reporter HTMLextra

To demonstrate to the team how to use Postman for API testing, I used Paulo Gon√ßalves [ServeRest](https://serverest.dev/) REST API.

Concepts used in the tests:

Dynamic variables
Pre-request scripts
Test scripts
JSON schema validation

### Setup

To view the tests and scripts used, simply import the collection and environment files that were used here directly into Postman. To execute the tests via Newman, follow these steps:

- Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install Newman:
```sh
npm install -g newman
```

Install the Newman report:
```sh
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

Run the tests through the project root directory:
```sh
newman run serverest-tech-sharing.postman_collection.json -e serverest-tech-sharing.postman_environment.json --reporters cli,htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export report.html
```

To view the test results, simply open the report.html that was created in the project root.
